# Detection-of-Steganography
Detection of LSB Replacement and LSB Matching Steganography Using Gray Level Run Length Matrix
<p>
A method to detect the typical LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding and the LSB matching steganography methods applied to grayscale images. The proposed method determines the changes made to some selected features extracted from the gray level run length matrix.
Features used for steganalysis method:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>GLNU (Gray Level Non-Uniformity)</li>
<li>RLN (Run Length Non-Uniformity)</li>
<li>Run Percentage/ Number of possible runs</li>
<li>Maximum length of run</li>
</ol>
